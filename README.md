# To do application by Otto Reimers
## u04

Welcome to my To do application where you can store things to do in a MySQL database. 

SQL files can be found in the folder "SQL-file". 

## Notes
- I created a user table but never really used it, but it should be set up for future use to have users login. 
- I mixed up "task" and "name" in the database. So "task" in the database is "name" on the application and "name" in the database is "task" on the application.
It's an easy fix, just taking some time, and it works just fine as it is.
